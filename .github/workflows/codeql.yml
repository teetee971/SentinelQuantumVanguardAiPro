# ============================================================================
# CodeQL Advanced Security Analysis
# ============================================================================
#
# THIS WORKFLOW IS DISABLED
# 
# Reason: GitHub recommends using ONLY ONE CodeQL configuration per repository.
# This repository uses "codeql-analysis.yml" as the primary CodeQL workflow.
#
# Having multiple CodeQL workflows causes conflicts with GitHub's Default setup
# and can lead to:
# - Duplicate scans
# - Conflicting results
# - Workflow failures
# - Security tab confusion
#
# This file is kept for reference but should NOT be active.
# To re-enable, delete or rename codeql-analysis.yml first.
# ============================================================================
#
# ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION (DISABLED):
# This workflow attempted to analyze java-kotlin with autobuild mode,
# which fails because this is a React Native project with no Java/Kotlin
# source code to compile (only pre-compiled Android wrapper).
