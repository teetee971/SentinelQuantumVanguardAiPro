# ============================================================================
# CodeQL Security Analysis - Frontend Only
# ============================================================================
#
# PROJECT SCOPE:
# This is a frontend web project (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
# Java/Kotlin are NOT part of the analyzed codebase.
#
# LANGUAGES ANALYZED:
# - javascript-typescript (web assets: HTML, CSS, JS, TS)
# - actions (GitHub Actions workflow security)
#
# EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED:
# - Java/Kotlin (not applicable to this frontend project)
# - Any setup-java, gradle, or Java autobuild steps
#
# EXCLUSION RATIONALE:
# Android APK build uses pre-compiled tools and is handled by dedicated
# CI/CD workflows (build-android.yml, release-apk.yml).
# Per GitHub CodeQL documentation, only languages present in the repository
# and relevant to security analysis should be configured.
#
# This configuration eliminates CodeQL Java/Kotlin exit code 32 errors
# by restricting analysis to actual project languages.
