Props to Tom MacWright @tmcw for a fantastic job!\n\n* [Features and use cases](#features)\n* [Getting started and configuration](#getting-started)\n* [Usage on Windows](#usage-on-windows)\n* [The command line](#the-command-line)\n* [Ignoring code for coverage](#ignoring-code-for-coverage)\n* [API](#api)\n* [Changelog](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [License and credits](#license)\n\n### Features\n\n* All-javascript instrumentation library that tracks **statement, branch,\nand function coverage**.\n* **Module loader hooks** to instrument code on the fly\n* **Command line tools** to run node unit tests \"with coverage turned on\" and no cooperation\nwhatsoever from the test runner\n* Multiple report formats: **HTML**, **LCOV**, **Cobertura** and more.\n* Ability to use as [middleware](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul-middleware) when serving JS files that need to be tested on the browser.\n* Can be used on the **command line** as well as a **library**\n* Based on the awesome `esprima` parser and the equally awesome `escodegen` code generator\n* Well-tested on node (prev, current and next versions) and the browser (instrumentation library only)\n\n### Use cases\n\nSupports the following use cases and more\n\n* transparent coverage of nodejs unit tests\n* instrumentation/ reporting of files in batch mode for browser tests\n* Server side code coverage for nodejs by embedding it as [custom middleware](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul-middleware)\n\n### Getting started\n\n    $ npm install -g istanbul\n\nThe best way to see it in action is to run node unit tests. Say you have a test\nscript `test.js` that runs all tests for your node project without coverage.\n\nSimply:\n\n    $ cd /path/to/your/source/root\n    $ istanbul cover test.js\n\nand this should produce a `coverage.json`, `lcov.info` and `lcov-report/*html` under `./coverage`\n\nSample of code coverage reports produced by this tool (for this tool!):\n\n[HTML reports](http://gotwarlost.github.com/istanbul/public/coverage/lcov-report/index.html)\n\n### Usage on Windows\n\nIstanbul assumes that the `command` passed to it is a JS file (e.g. Jasmine, vows etc.),\nthis is however not true on Windows where npm wrap bin files in a `.cmd` file.\nSince Istanbul can not parse `.cmd` files you need to reference the bin file manually.\n\nHere is an example using Jasmine 2:\n\n    istanbul cover node_modules\\jasmine\\bin\\jasmine.js\n\nIn order to use this cross platform (e.i. Linux, Mac and Windows), you can insert\nthe above line into the script object in your package.json file but with normal\nslash.\n\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": \"istanbul cover node_modules/jasmine/bin/jasmine.js\"\n    }\n\n### Configuring\n\nDrop a `.istanbul.yml` file at the top of the source tree to configure istanbul.\n`istanbul help config` tells you more about the config file format.\n\n### The command line\n\n    $ istanbul help\n\ngives you detailed help on all commands.\n\n```\nUsage: istanbul help config | <command>\n\n`config` provides help with istanbul configuration\n\nAvailable commands are:\n\n      check-coverage\n              checks overall/per-file coverage against thresholds from coverage\n              JSON files. Exits 1 if thresholds are not met, 0 otherwise\n\n\n      cover   transparently adds coverage information to a node command. Saves\n              coverage.json and reports at the end of execution\n\n\n      help    shows help\n\n\n      instrument\n              instruments a file or a directory tree and writes the\n              instrumented code to the desired output location\n\n\n      report  writes reports for coverage JSON objects produced in a previous\n              run\n\n\n      test    cover a node command only when npm_config_coverage is set. Use in\n              an `npm test` script for conditional coverage\n\n\nCommand names can be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous\n```\n\nTo get detailed help for a command and what command-line options it supports, run:\n\n    istanbul help <command>\n\n(Most of the command line options are not covered in this document.)\n\n#### The `cover` command\n\n    $ istanbul cover my-test-script.js -- my test args\n    # note the -- between the command name and the arguments to be passed\n\nThe `cover` command can be used to get a coverage object and reports for any arbitrary\nnode script. By default, coverage information is written under `./coverage` - this\ncan be changed using command-line options.\n\nThe `cover` command can also be passed an optional `--handle-sigint` flag to\nenable writing reports when a user triggers a manual SIGINT of the process that is\nbeing covered. This can be useful when you are generating coverage for a long lived process.\n\n#### The `test` command\n\nThe `test` command has almost the same behavior as the `cover` command, except that\nit skips coverage unless the `npm_config_coverage` environment variable is set.\n\n**This command is deprecated** since the latest versions of npm do not seem to\nset the `npm_config_coverage` variable.\n\n#### The `instrument` command\n\nInstruments a single JS file or an entire directory tree and produces an output\ndirectory tree with instrumented code. This should not be required for running node\nunit tests but is useful for tests to be run on the browser.\n\n#### The `report` command\n\nWrites reports using `coverage*.json` files as the source of coverage information.\nReports are available in multiple formats and can be individually configured\nusing the istanbul config file. See `istanbul help report` for more details.\n\n#### The `check-coverage` command\n\nChecks the coverage of statements, functions, branches, and lines against the\nprovided thresholds. Positive thresholds are taken to be the minimum percentage\nrequired and negative numbers are taken to be the number of uncovered entities\nallowed.\n\n### Ignoring code for coverage\n\n* Skip an `if` or `else` path with `/* istanbul ignore if */` or `/* istanbul ignore else */` respectively.\n* For all other cases, skip the next 'thing' in the source with: `/* istanbul ignore next */`\n\nSee [ignoring-code-for-coverage.md](ignoring-code-for-coverage.md) for the spec.\n\n\n### API\n\nAll the features of istanbul can be accessed as a library.\n\n#### Instrument code\n\n```javascript\n    var istanbul = require('istanbul');\n    var instrumenter = new istanbul.Instrumenter();\n\n    var generatedCode = instrumenter.instrumentSync('function meaningOfLife() { return 42; }',\n        'filename.js');\n```\n\n#### Generate reports given a bunch of coverage JSON objects\n\n```javascript\n    var istanbul = require('istanbul'),\n        collector = new istanbul.Collector(),\n        reporter = new istanbul.Reporter(),\n        sync = false;\n\n    collector.add(obj1);\n    collector.add(obj2); //etc.\n\n    reporter.add('text');\n    reporter.addAll([ 'lcov', 'clover' ]);\n    reporter.write(collector, sync, function () {\n        console.log('All reports generated');\n    });\n```\n\nFor the gory details consult the [public API](http://gotwarlost.github.com/istanbul/public/apidocs/index.html)\n\n\n### Multiple Process Usage\n\nIstanbul can be used in a multiple process environment by running each process\nwith Istanbul, writing a unique coverage file for each process, and combining\nthe results when generating reports. The method used to perform this will\ndepend on the process forking API used. For example when using the\n[cluster module](http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) you must setup the master\nto start child processes with Istanbul coverage, disable reporting, and output\ncoverage files that include the PID in the filename.  Before each run you may\nneed to clear out the coverage data directory.\n\n```javascript\n    if(cluster.isMaster) {\n        // setup cluster if running with istanbul coverage\n        if(process.env.running_under_istanbul) {\n            // use coverage for forked process\n            // disabled reporting and output for child process\n            // enable pid in child process coverage filename\n            cluster.setupMaster({\n                exec: './node_modules/.bin/istanbul',\n                args: [\n                    'cover', '--report', 'none', '--print', 'none', '--include-pid',\n                    process.argv[1], '--'].concat(process.argv.slice(2))\n            });\n        }\n        // ...\n        // ... cluster.fork();\n        // ...\n    } else {\n        // ... worker code\n    }\n```\n\n### Coverage.json\n\nFor details on the format of the coverage.json object, [see here](./coverage.json.md).\n\n### License\n\nistanbul is licensed under the [BSD License](http://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/raw/master/LICENSE).\n\n### Third-party libraries\n\nThe following third-party libraries are used by this module:\n\n* abbrev: https://github.com/isaacs/abbrev-js -  to handle command abbreviations\n* async: https://github.com/caolan/async - for parallel instrumentation of files\n* escodegen: https://github.com/Constellation/escodegen - for JS code generation\n* esprima: https://github.com/ariya/esprima - for JS parsing\n* glob: https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob - for loading and matching path expressions\n* handlebars: https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/ - for report template expansion\n* js-yaml: https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml - for YAML config file load\n* mkdirp: https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp - to create output directories\n* nodeunit: https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit - dev dependency for unit tests\n* nopt: https://github.com/isaacs/nopt - for option parsing\n* once: https://github.com/isaacs/once - to ensure callbacks are called once\n* resolve: https://github.com/substack/node-resolve - for resolving a post-require hook module name into its main file.\n* rimraf - https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf - dev dependency for unit tests\n* which: https://github.com/isaacs/node-which - to resolve a node command to a file for the `cover` command\n* wordwrap: https://github.com/substack/node-wordwrap - for prettier help\n* prettify: http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/ - for syntax colored HTML reports.

Istanbul has been specifically designed to offer an alternative to this library with an easy migration path.\n* cover: https://github.com/itay/node-cover - the inspiration for the `cover` command, modeled after the `run` command in that tool. The coverage methodology used by istanbul is quite different, however\n\n### Shout out to\n\n   * [mfncooper](https://github.com/mfncooper) - for great brainstorming discussions\n   * [reid](https://github.com/reid), [davglass](https://github.com/davglass), the YUI dudes, for interesting conversations, encouragement, support and gentle pressure to get it done :)\n\n### Why the funky name?\n\nSince all the good ones are taken. Comes from the loose association of ideas across\ncoverage, carpet-area coverage, the country that makes good carpets and so on...\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"jk6":true,"pid":true,"pwn":true,"rsp":true,"cedx":true,"dwqs":true,"gher":true,"gr2m":true,"jclo":true,"n370":true,"akiva":true,"cicci":true,"dralc":true,"irnnr":true,"kevmo":true,"panlw":true,"ritsu":true,"runeo":true,"t1st3":true,"temsa":true,"tivac":true,"volem":true,"ajduke":true,"buzuli":true,"dankle":true,"feyzee":true,"gliviu":true,"hserra":true,"jimnox":true,"joe223":true,"kaapex":true,"m64253":true,"mestar":true,"nhutle":true,"nhz.io":true,"potnox":true,"quafoo":true,"rawphp":true,"tcrowe":true,"tmpvar":true,"womjoy":true,"antanst":true,"arielfr":true,"biggora":true,"chakrit":true,"cslater":true,"da5atar":true,"dimilow":true,"eagerod":true,"fhinkel":true,"itonyyo":true,"jdacruz":true,"jerrywu":true,"ldsfish":true,"leizeng":true,"liunian":true,"maur1th":true,"mdrobny":true,"nadimix":true,"nohomey":true,"noopkat":true,"oldfish":true,"rdesoky":true,"sgvinci":true,"sopepos":true,"subchen":true,"teabyii":true,"tsxuehu":true,"xfloops":true,"abhisekp":true,"alanshaw":true,"amazonov":true,"amercier":true,"aubinlrx":true,"baishuiz":true,"cdokolas":true,"danday74":true,"dgarlitt":true,"djamseed":true,"drhelmut":true,"dzhou777":true,"edloidas":true,"fredcorn":true,"gchudnov":true,"gurunate":true,"haperlot":true,"hecto932":true,"hoitmort":true,"hugovila":true,"jlagunas":true,"jonathas":true,"julien-f":true,"kulyk404":true,"leonzhao":true,"liveinjs":true,"madarche":true,"mattyboy":true,"pnevares":true,"satans17":true,"suemcnab":true,"thekuzia":true,"tinyhill":true,"tombenke":true,"vchouhan":true,"voxpelli":true,"wangfeia":true,"xueboren":true,"ycjcl868":true,"zemgalis":true,"abuelwafa":true,"alefteris":true,"aquafadas":true,"bransorem":true,"dbrockman":true,"finnhvman":true,"flockonus":true,"fredsuire":true,"grabantot":true,"iceriver2":true,"imkitchen":true,"jhillacre":true,"jireve999":true,"joaocunha":true,"karthickt":true,"kizzlebot":true,"landy2014":true,"leomperes":true,"mastayoda":true,"mistkafka":true,"mondalaci":true,"nice_body":true,"onelaview":true,"rbecheras":true,"sasquatch":true,"sqrtthree":true,"acjohnso25":true,"amaxwell01":true,"beyond5959":true,"blackmagic":true,"brightchen":true,"cfleschhut":true,"charmander":true,"ericlondon":true,"fmoliveira":true,"gotwarlost":true,"hecticjeff":true,"henrytseng":true,"honestcode":true,"isaacvitor":true,"ismaelvsqz":true,"jessaustin":true,"k-kuwahara":true,"krostyslav":true,"leizongmin":true,"liushoukai":true,"marco.jahn":true,"monolithed":true,"piecioshka":true,"princetoad":true,"ridermansb":true,"willpracht":true,"wlabranche":true,"alopatindev":true,"blakeembrey":true,"chown_chmod":true,"flumpus-dev":true,"iandstanley":true,"ianmcburnie":true,"itsnotvalid":true,"jbdoumenjou":true,"kevin-smets":true,"mseminatore":true,"naokikimura":true,"octetstream":true,"psychollama":true,"rcarroll380":true,"silentcloud":true,"stonecypher":true,"vparaskevas":true,"wangnan0610":true,"xinwangwang":true,"brentlintner":true,"dpjayasekara":true,"ghostcode521":true,"hugojosefson":true,"ivan.marquez":true,"marcuspoehls":true,"mpinteractiv":true,"prabhash1785":true,"ristostevcev":true,"samhwang1990":true,"shanemileham":true,"stringparser":true,"thomas.miele":true,"crazyjingling":true,"highlanderkev":true,"itsananderson":true,"lassevolkmann":true,"laurentknauss":true,"sakthiifnotec":true,"slava.hatnuke":true,"slowjamhacker":true,"bradleybossard":true,"eirikbirkeland":true,"forbeslindesay":true,"peterkingsbury":true,"shanewholloway":true,"akashdeep-singh":true,"charlietango592":true,"nemanjapetrovic":true,"pensierinmusica":true,"vassiliy.pimkin":true,"horrorandtropics":true,"joris-van-der-wel":true,"recursion_excursion":true,"daniel-lewis-bsc-hons":true}}
