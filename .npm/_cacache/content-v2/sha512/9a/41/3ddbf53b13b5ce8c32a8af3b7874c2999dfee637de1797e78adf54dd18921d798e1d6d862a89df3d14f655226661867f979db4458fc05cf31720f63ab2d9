String value of a key will be returned\r\n- In absense of both `section` & `key`, whole data will be returned as an object with `sections`, `sectionOrder` as properties\r\n\r\n#\r\n3] Set anything you want ! \r\n```javascript\r\n    var success = piTheOne.addData(<value>, <section>, <key>);\r\n```\r\n- `section` is the name of the section. `value` should be given as an object in this case\r\n- `key` is the name of the property under some section. In absense of `section`, `_global` section will be used. `value` should be of String type in this case\r\n- In absense of both `section` & `key`, you can set the whole data for the instance. An object with `sections`, `sectionOrder` as properties should be given for `value`. `sections` property should have `_global` child property.\r\n\r\n#\r\n4] Remove anything you want ! \r\n```javascript\r\n    var success = piTheOne.removeData(<section>, <key>);\r\n```\r\n- `section` is the name of the section. In absense of `key` whole section will be removed.\r\n- `key` is the name of the property under some section. In absense of `section`, `_global` section will be used.\r\n- In absense of both `section` & `key`, whole instance data will be reset to empty state.\r\n\r\n\r\n#\r\n##### And, one more thing  ...\r\n#\r\n- Since the data is exposed as instance properties you can directly process them as you wish. But please respect the format PropINI expects the data to be in.\r\n- `piTheOne.sections` should always be an object\r\n- `piTheOne.sectionOrder` should always be an array and should be in sync with `piTheOne.sections` data\r\n- `piTheOne.sections` should always have a child object `_global`\r\n\r\n#\r\n##### LEGAL STUFF\r\n#\r\n- Check project's license info\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"paulbennetjoshua","email":"paulbennetjoshua@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-06-24T20:03:21.919Z","created":"2015-12-26T18:33:58.365Z","0.0.1":"2015-12-26T18:33:58.365Z","0.0.2":"2015-12-26T19:43:29.137Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/paulbennet/propini#readme","keywords":["propertyfile","ini"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/paulbennet/propini.git"},"author":{"name":"Paul Bennet"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/paulbennet/propini/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
